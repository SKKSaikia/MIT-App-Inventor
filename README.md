This repository contains few of the apps that I built in <b>MIT APP Inventor 2</b>.MIT App Inventor is a fun and easy way to build Android Apps. You can drag and drop buttons, ImageView, TextView etc to build the UI and in similar way drag and drop logic blocks to complete the logic of the App.It was fun creating the interesting Apps, the website contains several [tutorials](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials) which you can follow and build your own.
